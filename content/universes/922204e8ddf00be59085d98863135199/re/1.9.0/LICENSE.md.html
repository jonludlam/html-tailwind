         This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
         <br/>
         specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
         <br/>
         Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. 
         You<br/>
         can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about
         whether<br/>
         this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
         <br/>
         strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
         below.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
         <br/>
         not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
         that<br/>
         you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
         charge<br/>
         for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can
         get<br/>
         it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces
         of<br/>
         it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
         <br/>these things.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
         <br/>
         distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
         these<br/>
         rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
         for<br/>
         you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
         <br/>
         or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we
         gave<br/>
         you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
         source<br/>
         code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
         <br/>
         complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink
         them<br/>
         with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
         <br/>
         it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
         <br/>
         library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
         <br/>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<
         br/>
         there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
         <br/>
         modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
         <br/>
         that what they have is not the original version, so that the
         original<br/>
         author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
         <br/>introduced by others.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
         <br/>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
         <br/>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
         <br/>
         restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
         <br/>
         any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
         <br/>
         consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<
         br/>
         ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
         <br/>
         General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
         <br/>
         is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
         <br/>
         this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
         <br/>libraries into non-free programs.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
         <br/>
         a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
         <br/>
         combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
         <br/>
         General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
         <br/>
         entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
         <br/>
         Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
         <br/>the library.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License
         because it<br/>
         does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
         <br/>
         Public License.  It also provides other free software developers
         Less<br/>
         of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These
         disadvantages<br/>
         are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
         <br/>
         libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in
         certain<br/>special circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<
         br/>
         encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
         becomes<br/>
         a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
         <br/>
         allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
         <br/>
         library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In
         this<br/>
         case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
         <br/>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
         <br/>
         programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
         <br/>
         free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
         <br/>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
         <br/>
         operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
         <br/>system.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
         <br/>
         users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
         <br/>
         linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
         <br/>that program using a modified version of the Library.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<
         br/>
         modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between
         a<br/>
         &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the
         library&quot;.  The<br/>
         former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter
         must<br/>be combined with the library in order to run.

          least three years, to give the same user the materials
          specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
          than the cost of performing this distribution.

          copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above
          specified materials from the same place.

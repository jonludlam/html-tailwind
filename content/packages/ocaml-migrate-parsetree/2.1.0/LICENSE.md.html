         The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
         freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
         Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
         free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

         This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
         specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
         Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
         can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about
         whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the
         better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the
         explanations below.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
         not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
         that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
         charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code
         or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and
         use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
         that you can do these things.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
         distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
         these rights. These restrictions translate to certain
         responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or
         if you modify it.

         For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
         or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we
         gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
         source code. If you link other code with the library, you must
         provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can
         relink them with the library after making changes to the library and
         recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know
         their rights.

         We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the

         To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
         there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
         modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
         that what they have is not the original version, so that the
         original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that
         might be introduced by others.

         Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
         any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
         effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
         restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
         any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
         consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

         Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
         ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
         General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
         is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
         this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
         libraries into non-free programs.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
         a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
         combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
         General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
         entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
         Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
         the library.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License
         because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
         General Public License. It also provides other free software
         developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.
         These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
         Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license
         provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
         encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
         becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must
         be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
         library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
         case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
         software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
         programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
         free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
         non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
         operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
         system.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
         users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
         linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
         that program using a modified version of the Library.

         A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions

         The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library
         or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work
         based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any
         derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
         containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
         modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
         language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
         in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

        <p class="mt-4">
         &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the
         work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source
         code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
         associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
         control compilation and installation of the library.

         Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
         covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
         running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
         from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
         work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in
         a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the

           the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
           is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
           in the event an application does not supply such function or
           table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
           its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p class="mt-4">
           (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
           a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
           application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
           application-supplied function or table used by this function must
           be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
           root function must still compute square roots.)

         identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
         and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
         themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
         sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
         distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
         based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the
         terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
         to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
         who wrote it.

         In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the

           You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
           signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
           or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions
           are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
           Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
           based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
           License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
           distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

           Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the

           original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
           Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose
           any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
           granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
           by third parties with this License.

           infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
           issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
           agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
           License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
           License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
           your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
           obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
           Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
           royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
           receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
           way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
           entirely from distribution of the Library.

        <p class="mt-4">
         If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
         possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software
         that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by
         permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,
         under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
         It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
         effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
         have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where
         the full notice is found.

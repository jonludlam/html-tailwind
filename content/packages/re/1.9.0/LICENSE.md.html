         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid

         distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
         these<br/>
         rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
         for<br/>
         you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
         <br/>
         or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we
         gave<br/>
         you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
         source<br/>
         code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
         <br/>
         complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink
         them<br/>
         with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
         <br/>
         it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
         <br/>
         library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
         <br/>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<
         br/>
         there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
         <br/>
         modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
         <br/>
         that what they have is not the original version, so that the
         original<br/>
         author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
         <br/>introduced by others.

        <p class="mt-4">
         Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
         <br/>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
         <br/>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
         <br/>
         restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
         <br/>
         any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
         <br/>
         consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

         Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<
         br/>
         ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
         <br/>
         General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
         <br/>
         is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
         <br/>
         this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
         <br/>libraries into non-free programs.

         When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
         <br/>
         a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
         <br/>
         combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
         <br/>
         General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
         <br/>
         entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
         <br/>
         Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
         <br/>the library.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License
         because it<br/>
         does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
         <br/>
         Public License.  It also provides other free software developers
         Less<br/>
         of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These
         disadvantages<br/>
         are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
         <br/>
         libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in
         certain<br/>special circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<
         br/>
         encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
         becomes<br/>
         a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
         <br/>
         allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
         <br/>
         library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In
         this<br/>
         case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
         <br/>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
         <br/>
         programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
         <br/>
         free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
         <br/>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
         <br/>
         operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
         <br/>system.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
         Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
         <br/>
         users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
         <br/>
         linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
         <br/>that program using a modified version of the Library.

          corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever
          changes were used in the work (which must be distributed
          under
          Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable

          the
          Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
          to use the modified definitions.)
          
          b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
          the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time
          a
          copy of the library already present on the user's computer
          system,
          rather than copying library functions into the executable, and
          (2)
          will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
          the user installs one, as long as the modified version
          is
          interface-compatible with the version that the work was made
          with.
          
          c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
          least three years, to give the same user the materials
          specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
          than the cost of performing this distribution.
          
          d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to
          copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above
          specified materials from the same place.
          
          e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of
          these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
